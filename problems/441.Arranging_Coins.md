## 题目描述
```
You have a total of n coins that you want to form in a staircase shape, where every k-th row must have exactly k coins.

Given n, find the total number of full staircase rows that can be formed.

n is a non-negative integer and fits within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.

Example 1:
n = 5

The coins can form the following rows:
¤
¤ ¤
¤ ¤

Because the 3rd row is incomplete, we return 2.

Example 2:
n = 8

The coins can form the following rows:
¤
¤ ¤
¤ ¤ ¤
¤ ¤

Because the 4th row is incomplete, we return 3.

JavaScript Code
```js
/**
 * @param {number} n
 * @return {number}
 */
var arrangeCoins = function(n) {
  let p1 = 1, p2 = n, mid = 0, sum = 0
  while (p1 <= p2) {
    mid = ((p1 + p2) / 2) >> 0
    sum = (mid + 1) * mid / 2
    if (sum > n) p2 = mid - 1
    else if (sum < n) p1 = mid + 1
    else return mid
  }
  return p2
};
```

Python Code
```py
class Solution(object):
  def arrangeCoins(self, n):
    """
    :type n: int
    :rtype: int
    """
    p1, p2, mid, s = 1, n, 0, 0
    while p1 <= p2:
      mid = int((p1 + p2) // 2)
      s = (mid + 1) * mid / 2
      if s < n: p1 = mid + 1
      elif s > n: p2 = mid - 1
      else: return mid
    return p2
```
