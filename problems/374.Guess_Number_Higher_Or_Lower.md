## 题目描述
```
We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:

I pick a number from 1 to n. You have to guess which number I picked.

Every time you guess wrong, I'll tell you whether the number is higher or lower.

You call a pre-defined API guess(int num) which returns 3 possible results (-1, 1, or 0):

-1 : My number is lower
 1 : My number is higher
 0 : Congrats! You got it!
 
Example :
Input: n = 10, pick = 6
Output: 6
```

## 代码

* 语言支持：JS, Python

JavaScript Code
```js
/** 
 * Forward declaration of guess API.
 * @param {number} num   your guess
 * @return 	            -1 if num is lower than the guess number
 *			             1 if num is higher than the guess number
 *                       otherwise return 0
 * var guess = function(num) {}
 */

/**
 * @param {number} n
 * @return {number}
 */
var guessNumber = function(n) {
  let p1 = 1, p2 = n, mid = 0
  while (p1 <= p2) {
    mid = ((p1 + p2) / 2) >> 0
    if (guess(mid) == 1) p1 = mid + 1
    else if (guess(mid) == -1) p2 = mid - 1
    else return mid
  }
};
```

Python Code
```py
# The guess API is already defined for you.
# @param num, your guess
# @return -1 if my number is lower, 1 if my number is higher, otherwise return 0
# def guess(num):

class Solution(object):
  def guessNumber(self, n):
    """
    :type n: int
    :rtype: int
    """
    p1, p2, mid = 1, n, 0
    while p1 <= p2:
      mid = int((p1 + p2) // 2)
      if guess(mid) == 1: p1 = mid + 1
      elif guess(mid) == -1: p2 = mid - 1
      else: return mid
```
